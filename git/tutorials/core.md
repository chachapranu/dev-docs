# Core Git Concepts

## Repository
A repository (repo) is a directory tracked by Git, containing your project files and history.

## Commit
A commit is a snapshot of your files at a point in time. Each commit has a unique ID.

## Staging Area (Index)
The staging area is where you prepare changes before committing. Use `git add` to stage files.

## Branch
A branch is a parallel version of your repository. The default branch is usually `main` or `master`.

## Merge
Merging combines changes from one branch into another.

## Remote
A remote is a version of your repository hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub).

## Clone
Cloning copies a remote repository to your local machine.

## Pull
Pulling fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository.

## Push
Pushing sends your local commits to a remote repository.
