# The Linux Filesystem

The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical tree structure. The root of the tree is `/`.

Key directories:

*   `/bin`: Essential user binaries
*   `/etc`: System configuration files
*   `/home`: User home directories
*   `/var`: Variable data, such as logs
*   `/tmp`: Temporary files
