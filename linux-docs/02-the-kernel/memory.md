# Memory Management

Memory management is one ofthe kernel's most complex and critical jobs. Its goal is to share the physical RAM among many processes fairly and safely, while also providing powerful abstractions to make programming easier.

### The Problem: Limited, Shared Physical Memory

You have a finite amount of physical RAM. Many processes want to use it. If processes accessed physical RAM directly, they could:

*   Steal memory from each other.
*   Accidentally (or maliciously) read or write to each other's memory, causing crashes and security holes.
*   Crash the kernel itself.

### The Solution: Virtual Memory

The kernel solves this by giving every process its own **virtual address space**. Think of it as a private, numbered list of memory slots, from 0 up to a very large number. The process thinks it has this entire range of memory all to itself.

This is an illusion. The kernel, with the help of a hardware unit called the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**, maintains a set of maps (page tables) for each process. These maps translate the virtual addresses used by the process into the actual physical addresses in RAM.

This mapping is the key. It allows the kernel to:

*   **Isolate Processes:** The MMU will throw an error if a process tries to access a virtual address that isn't in its map. This prevents it from ever touching another process's memory.
*   **Use RAM Efficiently:** The physical memory for a process doesn't have to be in one contiguous block. The kernel can map different virtual addresses to scattered physical pages, making it easier to fit more processes into memory.
*   **Enable Swapping:** If the physical RAM is full, the kernel can take a chunk of memory from an inactive process, save it to the hard disk (in the **swap space**), and use the freed RAM for something else. If the original process becomes active again, the kernel brings the data back from the disk. This makes the system appear to have more memory than it physically does.
*   **Share Memory:** Different processes can have entries in their maps that point to the same physical RAM page. This is how shared libraries work. The code for a common library like `libc` is only loaded into physical RAM once, but it is mapped into the virtual address space of every process that uses it, saving a huge amount of memory.

Virtual memory is a cornerstone of modern operating systems, providing security, stability, and flexibility.
