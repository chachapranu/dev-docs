# Permissions

Linux uses a permission system to control access to files and directories. There are three types of permissions:

*   **Read (r):** View the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
*   **Write (w):** Modify a file or create/delete files in a directory.
*   **Execute (x):** Run a file as a program.

Permissions are assigned to three types of users:

*   **Owner:** The user who owns the file.
*   **Group:** The group that owns the file.
*   **Other:** All other users.
