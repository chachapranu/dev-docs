# Linux Kernel

The Linux kernel is the core of the Linux operating system. It is the first program that is loaded when the computer starts. The kernel is responsible for managing the system's resources, such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals. It also provides a number of services to user applications, such as file system access, networking, and process management.
